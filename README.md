# PortfolioProject



## Progress Notes
- August: Project started. I liked the way in which I organised my general layout and divs for my previous website project. So I have decided to use a similar approach when it comes to the HTML part of the code. 
- Monday September 11th: Today my objective is to decide rooughly how my protfolio should be layed out. I want the foundations of my code to be very clear and simple. This will avoid unnecessary complication further down the line. 
- Throughout my research I have decided to prepare media query parameters to ensure a responsive design and to avoid issues later down the line. 
- I have also decided to seperate each section of my CSS styling into seperate CSS files. Having them all in one place soon becomes cluttered and confusing. This way, my code will be easier to return to for both me and any other person who wishes to read it.
