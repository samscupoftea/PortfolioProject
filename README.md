# PortfolioProject



## Progress Notes
- August: Project started. I liked the way in which I organised my general layout and divs for my previous website project. So I have decided to use a similar approach when it comes to the HTML part of the code. 
- Monday September 11th: Today my objective is to decide rooughly how my protfolio should be layed out. I want the foundations of my code to be very clear and simple. This will avoid unnecessary complication further down the line.
